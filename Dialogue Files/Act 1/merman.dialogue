Fisherman: Hey! I've been noticing my nets are lighter these days. You wouldn't happen to know anything about that, would you?

Mermaid: Oh, I might have borrowed a fish... or a dozen. They looked so trapped and sad in those nets.

- I need those fish to make a living! Can't you find your food elsewhere?
	Mermaid: I understand your concern, but the sea is not what it used to be. It's harder for us to find food too.
	- Maybe there's a way we can help each other.
		Mermaid: That's a thoughtful proposal. What did you have in mind?
		- What if you guide the fish into my nets in exchange for part of the catch?
			Mermaid: That sounds fair. It ensures food for both of us.
			=> END
		- How about you stop taking fish from my nets, and I'll help clean the sea to make it easier for you to find food?
			Mermaid: A cleaner sea means more fish for everyone. It's a deal!
			=> END
	- How am I supposed to live like this? You need to stop.
		Mermaid: I didn't realize the impact of my actions. I'll find another way.
		- Thank you for understanding.
			Mermaid: I hope we can live in harmony from now on.
			=> END
		- I'll believe it when I see it.
			Mermaid: I'll prove it to you. Give me a chance.
			=> END

- How can you be so selfish? The sea is vast!
	Mermaid: The sea might be vast, but not all of it is kind to creatures like me.
	- Then let's work on making the sea a better place for both of us.
		Mermaid: Your heart is as vast as the sea itself. I'd be honored to work alongside you.
		- Let's start by tackling the pollution problem.
			Mermaid: Together, we can make a significant difference.
			=> END
		- We need to create safe zones for all sea creatures.
			Mermaid: Safe zones would ensure peace and abundance for us all.
			=> END
	- You're just making excuses. Find another way to feed yourself.
		Mermaid: I see your point. It's unfair for me to burden you with my problems.
		- I appreciate your understanding.
			Mermaid: Let's hope for a brighter future for both of us.
			=> END
		- Actions speak louder than words.
			Mermaid: I'll show you my good intentions through my actions.
			=> END
