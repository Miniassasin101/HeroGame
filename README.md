Made in Godot 4.2

This is a project to create a fantasy grid turn based tactics game in the style of games like gears tactics, triangle strategy, and fire emblem.
The goal is to first create a robust and modular ai and combat system, and form the rest of the game around that.

This Game has an isometric viewpoint, and as of right now, portrays 2d characters in a 3d environment.
Anyone who views this open source project can probably repurpose from the AStar3D pathfinding method, or the AI, for their own use.

Any Tips or advice is much appreciated!
